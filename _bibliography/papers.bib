  abstract  = {While most existing works on LLM prompt-engineering focus only on how to select a better set of data samples inside one single prompt input (In-Context Learning or ICL), why can't we design and leverage multiple prompt inputs together to further improve the LLM performance? In this work, we propose In-Context Sampling (ICS), a low-resource LLM prompt-engineering technique to produce the most confident prediction results by optimizing the construction of multiple ICL prompt inputs. Extensive experiments with two SOTA LLMs (FlanT5-XL and Mistral-7B) on three NLI datasets (e-SNLI, Multi-NLI, and ANLI) illustrate that ICS can consistently enhance LLM's prediction performance and confidence. An ablation study suggests that a diversity-based ICS strategy may further improve LLM's performance, which sheds light on a new yet promising future research direction.},

  abstract  = {Interactive storytelling is vital for preschooler development. While children's interactive partners have traditionally been their parents and teachers, recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have sparked a surge of AI-based storytelling technologies. As these technologies become increasingly ubiquitous in preschoolers' lives, questions arise regarding how they function in practical storytelling scenarios and, in particular, how parents, the most critical stakeholders, experience and perceive these technologies. This paper investigates these questions through a qualitative study with 17 parents of children aged 3-6. Our findings suggest that even though AI-based storytelling technologies provide more immersive and engaging interaction, they still cannot meet parents' expectations due to a series of interactive, functional, and algorithmic challenges. We elaborate on these challenges and discuss the possible implications of future AI-based storytelling technologies for preschoolers. We conclude by highlighting the design implications for future AI-based storytelling technologies.},

  abstract  = {Interactive story reading is a common parent-child activity, where parents expect to teach both language skills and real-world knowledge beyond the story. While increasing storytelling and reading systems have been developed for this activity, they often fail to infuse real-world knowledge into the conversation. This limitation can be attributed to the existing question-answering (QA) datasets used for children’s education, upon which the systems are built, failing to capture the nuances of how education experts think when conducting interactive story reading activities. To bridge this gap, we design an annotation framework, empowered by existing knowledge graph to capture experts’ annotations and thinking process, and leverage this framework to construct StorySparkQA dataset, which comprises 5, 868 expert-annotated QA pairs with real-world knowledge. We conduct automated and human expert evaluations across various QA pair generation settings to demonstrate that our StorySparkQA can effectively support models in generating QA pairs that target real-world knowledge beyond story content. StorySparkQA is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/NEU-HAI/StorySparkQA.},

	abstract     = {With the growing availability of quantitative forecasts from various sources, effectively communicating these multiple forecasts has become increasingly crucial. Recent advances have explored using Multiple-Forecast Visualizations (MFVs) to display multiple time-series forecasts. However, how to systematically sample from a pool of disparate forecasts to create MFVs that effectively facilitate decision-making requires further investigation. To address this challenge, we examine two cluster-based sampling strategies for creating MFVs and three designs for visualizing them to assist people in decision-making with forecasts. Through two online studies (Experiment 1 n = 711 and Experiment 2 n = 400) and over 15 decision-making-related metrics, we evaluated participants' perceptions of eight visualization designs using historical COVID-19 forecasts as a test bed. Our findings revealed that one sampling method significantly enhanced participants' ability to predict future outcomes, thereby reducing their surprise when confronted with the actual outcomes. Importantly, since no approach excels in all metrics, we advise choosing different visualization designs based on communication goals. Furthermore, qualitative response data demonstrate a correlation between response consistency and people's inclination to extrapolate from the forecast segment of the visualization. This research offers insights into how to improve visualizations of multiple forecasts using an automated and empirically validated technique for selecting forecasts that outperform common techniques on several key metrics and reduce overplotting.},
